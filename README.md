 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Petru's Tech Journey</h3></summary>
   My journey in tech has been a thrilling ride of constant learning and innovation. Starting as a curious computer science student, I quickly found my passion in web development, mastering JavaScript and its ecosystem. As I delved deeper into the world of coding, I realized the power of creating solutions that can impact businesses and people's lives.

   My career took off as a full-stack developer, where I honed my skills in both frontend and backend technologies. The experience of working on diverse projects, from e-commerce platforms to complex management systems, gave me a comprehensive understanding of the software development lifecycle.

   However, it was the advent of AI and its potential to revolutionize industries that truly captured my imagination. This led me to create AiFrontDesk, an AI-powered call center solution that combines my love for cutting-edge technology with practical business applications.

   Today, as I continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with code, I'm also passionate about sharing my knowledge and experiences with the tech community. Whether it's through mentoring, creating content, or contributing to open-source projects, I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning in the ever-evolving world of technology.

   Looking ahead, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie at the intersection of AI, web technologies, and business solutions. My goal is to keep innovating, learning, and creating digital solutions that make a real difference in how businesses operate and serve their customers.
